# Backgrounder document
In the Halifax Regional Municipality, where rental vacancy rates and housing demand continue to threaten market stability, housing affordability is still a crucial concern. Halifax’s purpose built rental vacancy rate increased to roughly 3.1% in the 2025 Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Rental Market Report from around 2.1% in 2024 (Rental Market Report, 2025). However this is still below long-term historical averages, suggesting ongoing supply constraints in relation to demand. In 2025, average rents in HRM also increased, surpassing income growth for many households, especially in lower cost rental market categories. This suggests that there is still pressure on affordability for both first time buyers and renters. The main choice that HRM planners must take is whether to continue depending on suburban greenfield construction to increase the supply of housing or to give priority to zoning changes to allow for higher density building within established neighbourhoods. In addition to making greater use of the current infrastructure such as roads, sewage ETC, higher density housing like duplexes and residential buildings is sometimes linked to cheaper municipal service costs per unit. The density plans, however, may encounter strong opposition from society and numerous laws and regulations that limit adoption and delay execution (Government of Canada, Statistics Canada, 2026). On the other hand, suburban greenfield development can provide new homes more quickly and on a greater scale, but it frequently costs governments a lot of money for long-term infrastructure. These expenses, which could put strain on HRM’s financial viability if long-term revenues do not balance infrastructure liabilities, include building and maintaining new transportation routes, and public services throughout scattered development regions. For elected officials and city planners, the choice is difficult and complex because of the tradeoffs suggested by these opposing tactics (Home, n.d.).  This decision affects a number of stakeholders. While current homeowners may be worried about changes to the neighbourhood’s character or increased density close to their properties, renters and potential homeowners in HRM are immediately impacted by the relative price and accessibility of housing options. When developing housing strategies, local officials must consider infrastructure costs, regulatory consequences and public interests. Developers respond to zoning restrictions and land use policies that influence investment decisions (Home, n.d.).  Stakeholders in the transportation and environmental sectors also have a stake because low density expansion may increase reliance on cars, while more compact growth patterns typically encourage transit use and lower emissions. HRM has begun the creation of a comprehensive Housing Strategy that will serve as a roadmap for future housing action within the municipality, as well as enact a number of planning modifications in response to persistent affordability issues. This approach, which is linked to the government Housing Accelerator Fund, focuses on combining municipal planning initiatives with more general affordability objectives and establishing more favorable regulatory conditions for a diverse housing supply (Home, n.d.).Over the following ten years, HRM’s housing affordability, urban structure, and financial stability will be impacted by the decision’s conclusion. The consequences of how and where new housing is constructed are crucial to fairness and economic sustainability in the area, as rents are growing and vacancy rates remain below historical averages (Rental Market Report, 2025).
