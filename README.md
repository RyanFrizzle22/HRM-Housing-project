## Housing Affordability and Fiscal Sustainability in Halifax 
## Decision Statement 
Should the halifax Reginal Municipality prioritze zoning reform to enable higher-density housing in established neighbourhoodsor continue expanding housingsupply through suburban greenfield development, in order to improve affordability while maintaining municipal fiscal sustainabilityy over the next decade. 
## Executive Summary 
Housing affordability in the Halifax Regonal Municipality has become increasingly strained as population growth, low vacancy rates, and rising housing costs placepressure on renters and prospective homebuyers. at the same time, the municipality faces long term fiscal challenges related to infrastructure expansion and service delivery, making decisions about housing development patterns especially consequential. how and where new housing is built therefor has significant implications for both affordability outcomes and municipal financial sustainability.

This project evaluates the tradeoffs between enabling higher density housig through zoning reform in established neighbourhoods and continuing to expand housing supply through suburban greenfield development. using housing and demographic data alongside systems thinking tools, the analysis examines how these strategies influence housing supply, prices, infrastructure costs, and fiscal pressure overtime. The goal is to provide evidence based guidence to support municipal decision makers in balancing housing affordably with long term fiscal sustainability over the next decade.
